{{% photo src="/img/me.png" alt="Me" %}}

I'm a full stack engineer currently stationed in Zagreb, Croatia. My main stack is based on JavaScript, these days it revolves around React and Node (coupled with Hapi.js mostly). I'm part of a team working at [Kanban (knb.io)](https://knb.io) where we are developing cool things for both startups and enterprises.

I'm always looking for freelancing opportunities and fun projects to work on. If you think we could work together you can check my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davor-badrov-670b0312b/).

To list the skills & technologies which I'm familiar with:

- Frontend: React, React Native, Angular 1.x, Backbone
- Backed: Node, Hapi.js, Express.js, Sequelize, SQL, Redis, WebSockets, ElasticSearch
- Misc: Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Git, Progressive web apps, Continuous Integration, Unit and Integration testing

Currently I'm into learning [Elixir](elixir-lang.org) and related technologies like the [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/) framework, and [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto). The language is pleasant to work with, the parts I find most interesting are functional programming itself, pattern matching, immutability and it's tooling.
