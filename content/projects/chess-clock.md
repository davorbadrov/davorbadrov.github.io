This is a PWA I made with Preact (and preact-cli). It's an open sourced chess clock. It has a `100/100` lighthouse score.
The project is hosted with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and can be seen [here](https://chess-clock-63e5e.firebaseapp.com/). You can check it's [source here](https://github.com/davorbadrov/chess-clock).
