A project I made in colaboration with Rade Koroman, my budy who is a designer. It's a free and open source solution with an UI for getting coordinates for locations. You can check it [here](http://geocoding-services.surge.sh), and it's [source here](https://github.com/davorbadrov/geocoding-service).

It's a frontend only project made in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and it uses [OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) free API for geolocation (getting coordinates out of locations). The app was bootstraped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
